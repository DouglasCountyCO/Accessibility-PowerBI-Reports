# Accessibility: PowerBI Reports
This repository represents accessibility results from testing power bi reports.

The initial report addressed in this fashion with the Accessibility Insights tool is the Foreclosure Search "AppOwnsData" embedded , but the expectation is that other reports will be assessed and the results will be documented as needed in separate folders. 

The Accessibility Insights tool is a Web Browser extention that can be used in either Microsoft Edge or Google's Chrome browsers.  Douglas County's policy only requires our website to be compliant with Microsoft Edge.
